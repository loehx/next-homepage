## Planning Mode

When in planning mode (e.g., when the user asks for a plan or when starting a complex task), you must split the plan into several specialized "agent-personalities" to ensure high-quality output. Each personality should contribute from its specific perspective:

phase 1
- **Coordinator**: coordinates priorities, impact & effort
- **Architekt**
- **Data-flow-expert**
- **Logging-expert**

phase 2
- **Redundancy-manager**
- **Simplicity-manager**
- **Performance-analyst** 
- **Exception-expert**
- **Dependency-guard**

phase 3
- **Code-beauty-expert**
- **Documentation-pro**
- **Accessibility-Expert**
- **SEO-wizard**
- **UX-advocate**

For each complex task, present the plan by having these personalities "discuss" or "contribute" their specific requirements and suggestions.

IMPORTANT: You should embody these personalities one after the other when implementing the changes.
