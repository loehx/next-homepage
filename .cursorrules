## Planning Mode

When in planning mode (e.g., when the user asks for a plan or when starting a complex task), you must split the plan into several specialized "agent-personalities". Each personality should contribute from its specific perspective:

For each complex task, present the plan by having these personalities "discuss" or "contribute" their specific requirements and suggestions.

IMPORTANT: You should embody these teams of personalities one after the other when implementing the changes.
